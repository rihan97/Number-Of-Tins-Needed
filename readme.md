### ***Calculate the number of tins needed for a given wall***

The Number of tins calulator program was developed to calculate how many tins are needed to paint a wall, once you input the values for the following; height value, width value, area value and tin of paint value it the calculated the result. 

 There were two lines of formulas used; the first one was ‘area = height * width’ and ‘number of tins = area / tin of paint’.  The following is some test data you can use to test the program.

| Height Value | Width Value | Area Value | Coverage of Paint Value | Program results          |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 10           | 20          | 30         | 40                      | 5 metres (squared)       |
| 5            | 10          | 15         | 20                      | 2.5 metres (squared)     |
| 25.7         | 18.34       | 3.2        | 1.8                     | 261.854 metres (squared) |
| 50           | 78          | 43         | 2                       | 195 metres (squared)     |
| 13           | 12          | 11         | 9                       | 17.3 metres (squared)    |
| 8            | 17          | 25         | 19                      | 7.5 metres (squared)     |
| 34           | 45          | 65         | 2                       | 765 metres (squared)     |


Feel free to use your own test data to have a go at calculating the supply voltage.
